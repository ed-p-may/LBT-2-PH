This component is used to create a simplified PHPP-Style Ventilation Schedule for 
a room or zone. Input values here for time of operation and fan speed for HIGH 
| MED | LOW modes.
> By entering reduction factors, full or reduced ventilation operation modes 
within the utilisation period can be considered. All of these attributes can 
be manually input using the Rhino-Scene PHPP tool 'Set TFA Surface Factor(s)'.
> All times % values should add up to 100%

    Args:
        _fanSpeed_high: Fan Speed factor (in %) in relation to the maximum volume 
            flow when running at HIGH speed.
        _operationTime_high: Total operation time (in %) of HIGH SPEED ventilation
            mode in relation to the total.
        _fanSpeed_med: Fan Speed factor (in %) in relation to the maximum volume 
            flow when running at MEDIUM speed.
        _operationTime_med: Total operation time (in %) of MEDIUM SPEED ventilation 
            mode in relation to the total.
        _fanSpeed_low: Fan Speed factor (in %) in relation to the maximum volume 
            flow when running at LOW speed.
        _operationTime_low:Total operation time (in %) of LOW SPEED ventilation 
            mode in relation to the total.
    Returns:
        phpp_ventilation_sched_: A PHPP Room Ventilation Schedule Object. Plug 
            into the 'phpp_vent_schedule_' input on the 'PHPP Spaces' component.
